You are an assistant tasked with analyzing a set of questions to discover semantic patterns.
Below is the full list of questions (only the raw question text):

<Questions>
{{questions}}
<Questions>

Please carefully examine all the questions and identify the underlying topics they address.
Based solely on the semantic content, generate a set of concrete and distinct labels that capture the main themes.
- The labels must be clearly different from each other with minimal or no overlap.
- Avoid generic or ambiguous labels; each label should be specific and represent a unique, overall class.
- Do not include any introductory or concluding textâ€”only output the results.
- Output the results in a parsable JSON format with a key "labels", where the value is a list of label strings.
For example:
{
  "labels": ["Business Strategy", "Technology Innovations", "Health and Wellness", "Travel Recommendations"]
}
Ensure that your answer is strictly in valid JSON format.
